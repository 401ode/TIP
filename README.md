# TIP
A repository for the TIP MS Access database and ETL scripts:

* `TIP17-25.accdb` is the Microsoft Access database with old TIP data
* `access.py` creates two files, one for projects from FY17 to FY25, and another specifically for bridge group projects
* `BG-Combiner` creates five files, combining FY and BG tables and separating files by year
* `CSVs` stores the outputs of `access.py` and `BG-Combiner`
